# Regression and Classification code
Python codes for      
Linear regression with gradient descent,   
Collaborative filtering,  
Linear regression with random data,   
Naive Bayes on Movie review etc    



Note: (For Naive Bayes on movie review) This zip file having all the data for both positive and negative reviews (both 700-700) and this python file too. The path in the code file for reading positive and negative data files is given with assumption that both folders are in current directory. So please keep all three ( pos_folder, neg_folder, python_file) at one place.
